# C++ Projects

A collection of C++ projects developed as part of an internship program, showcasing problem-solving and programming skills. Projects include a File Manager, Number Guessing Game, and Sudoku Solver.

# C++ Projects ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed during my internship. The projects demonstrate my ability to solve problems and create applications using C++. Below are the details of each project:

## Projects Included

### 1. **File Manager Program**
   - **Description**:  
     This C++ program is a simple file manager that allows users to perform basic file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can select the desired operation by entering the corresponding choice. It handles invalid choices gracefully by prompting the user to try again.

   - **Uses**:
     - **Creating Files**: Users can create new files and specify the content to be written to the file.
     - **Reading Files**: Users can read the content of existing files.
     - **Writing to Files**: Users can append new content to existing files.
     - **Deleting Files**: Users can delete files that are no longer needed.

   - **Note**:  
     This program was so easy to create that it was completed in just 2 days. It serves as a great example of how basic file operations can be implemented in C++ using a simple menu-driven approach.

### 2. **Number Guessing Game**
   - **Description**:  
     This C++ program is a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts. The player can continue playing multiple rounds, and the program records the best score (fewest attempts) achieved.

   - **Uses**:
     - **Entertainment**: Provides a fun and engaging way to pass the time.
     - **Practice**: Helps players improve their guessing strategies and number sense.
     - **Programming Example**: Demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and random number generation in C++.

   - **Note**:  
     This program was so easy to create that it was completed in just 3 days. It showcases how to implement a simple game with user interaction and score tracking in C++.

### 3. **Sudoku Solver**
   - **Description**:  
     This C++ program is a Sudoku solver that allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and solve it. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose to solve the puzzle, print the current grid, clear the grid, or validate the puzzle. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle.

   - **Uses**:
     - **Solving Sudoku Puzzles**: Automatically solves Sudoku puzzles provided by the user.
     - **Validation**: Checks if a given Sudoku puzzle is valid.
     - **Educational Tool**: Helps users understand the logic and algorithms behind solving Sudoku puzzles.
     - **Practice**: Allows users to practice solving Sudoku puzzles by providing solutions and validation.

   - **Note**:  
     This program was so easy to create that it was completed in just 3 days. It demonstrates the use of backtracking algorithms, grid manipulation, and user interaction in C++. The program is a great example of how to implement a Sudoku solver with additional functionalities like validation and grid management.
